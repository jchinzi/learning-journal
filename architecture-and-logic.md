**Computer Architecture and Logic**

#### What makes a computer a computer?

Basic Goals:
* Take input
* Store information
* Process information
* Output results

#### Computers work on a Binary System
> Where the traditional western decimal number system works on a power of 10 using the digits 0 - 9, the *Binary Number System* works on a power of 2, using only the digits 0 and 1.  This allows electricity to be used to store data, because 0 and 1 can translate to the electrical current in a single wire being *OFF* or *ON*.  Adding more wires thus lets you count to exponentially higher numbers.

This method of using a binary number system to represent data lends itself most clearly to mathmatical data (numbers), but can in fact represent far more than that.  

>Numbers can be assigned to represent letters, translating binary code to text.

>Numbers can be assigned to represent individual pixels, which when assembled together can translate binary code to images and graphics.

>Numbers can be used to represent sound waves, which translate binary code to audio information.

The role of input devices, then, is to convert physical input into binary information that can be stored and processed by a computer.  Conversely, output devices take that processed information and convert it from binary back into a physical output that can be accessed in a useful way by the consumer.
