#####Thursday, April 23rd   **Growth Mindset**

After reading Steve Haffenden's (article) [https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset] *How you can benefit from a growth mindset*, my general impression is that a growth mindset reframes the definiton of "success" to focus on investing effort and experiencing growth of understanding and abilities, rather than soley judging success by ability and output.  Therefore, rather than sticking to what you're "good at", a growth mindset encourages you to lean into those areas that may not come as naturally or as easily and giving yourself space to try, stumble, and improve.

Embracing a growth mindset can be a challenge for me - it feels uncomfortable to face the fact that there are certain skill sets that just don't come naturally or easily to me, and that to improve I'm first going to have to reveal myself to be *not that smart after all* :scream:

So, as I continue on in my my coding education (and life in general, really) I will strive to remember:
- Personal and Professional Growth will require Effort (sometimes more than expected).
- Criticism is not a personal attack - instead, it is a learning opportunity.  Take it as such and *LISTEN*.
- Don't be intimidated by or jealous of the success of others.  Be inspired and see them as potential resources.
