# Welcome to My Learning Journal!

## About Me

My name is Jennifer Chinzi and I'm a 32 year old Seattlite taking my first steps into the world of coding.  That includes setting up a [Github Portolio](https://github.com/jchinzi)!  

This page is a documentation of the work I've done as a part of Code 102, Code Fellows' entry level coding class.
