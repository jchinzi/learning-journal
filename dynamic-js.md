**Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript**

We've already talked about HTML (the *content* of your webpage) and CSS (the *presentation* of your webpage) - now it's time to add a third layer, *behavior*!

JavaScript adds interactive elements to our webpage.  Much like CSS, JavaScript can be inserted right into our HTML, but in most cases it's advised to keep your JavaScript in it's own file (.js) that can then be referenced within the HTML using `<script></script>` tags.

Also, note that JavaScript **is case sensitive**.

When writing in JavaScript, there are a few new terms it is important to understand.

|Term|Definition|
|:--|--:|
|script|A series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one|
|statement|Each individual instruction within a script, ending with a semicolon|
|code block|Statement surrounded by curly braces - the closing curly brace is **not** followed by a semicolon|
|`*`variable|Short term repositories for information necessary to complete a script.  The value of the variable may be changed within the same script.|
|keyword|Used to create a variable (ex. var)|
|assignment operator|Allows one to assign a value to a variable.  Expressed as =|
|
`*`A few rules to remember when naming variables:
* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($) or underscore (_).  It may **not** begin with a number.
* The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($) or underscore (_) but **cannot** contain a dash (-) or period (.).
* **Keywords** and **Reserved Words** may not be used as variable names.
* Variable names, like everything else in JavaScript, are case sensitive.
* It's best to use descriptive names so you remember what your variable is meant to hold.
* camelCase is considered good form for variables that are more than one word.

JavaScript recoginizes three distinct data types:

* Numeric Data Types (numbers, including decimals and negatives)
* String Data Types (Text enclosed in single or double quotes)
* Boolean Data Types (True or False)
