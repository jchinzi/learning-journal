**The Coder's Computer**

One of the most useful tools in a coder's toolbag is their text editor.  And on the surface, the name sounds like it should say it all - right?  A text editor is software that allows you to *edit text*.  But while most people these days have used programs like Word or Google Docs to compose assignments for school or draft a letter, text editors used by coders are unique in a few ways.

1. They don't support editing in the usual sense, meaning that playing with font size, **bolding**, *italicizing* or otherwise cosmetically altering the text is far from the point and actually isn't supported by most text editors.  This is because code is written in plain text - all the magic happens when the code runs.

1. They *may* support features specific to supporting coders, such as:
    1. Code Completion
    1. Syntax Highlighting
    1. Visual Themes (which can reduce eye strain as well a improving the look of your workspace)
    1. Extensions (which can allow for customazation and expanded utility)

Why do I say *may*?  Because there are different types of text editors out there that can very greatly in what they offer and who they may appeal to.

As a rule, every computer comes with a native text editor.  Which one will depened on what kind of computer you're using - where Macs have **Text Edit**, Windows systems come with **Notepad**, but both serve a very similar function.  They allow you to write, edit, and save text.  Period.  For coders who are just getting started, this may be a useful tool to use while practicing the basics and building muscle memory of the core structures of code.  However, the downside of this barebones approach is that it really doesn't offer any assistance.  All those support features mentioned earlier, they can be found by seeking out 3rd party text editors developed specificially for coders.

Again, like the native text editor, the kind of computer you're using will dictate what 3rd party text editors are available to you. For example, [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is only compatable with Windows whereas [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is a Mac app.  However, several popular options such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), and [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) all support versions for Mac, Windows, and even Linux users.  Across the board, these programs are unique from the native text editors in that they specifically support users in more comfortably and efficiently writing code by offering features such as those mentioned earlier.  They are also regularly updated to better support users moving forward.

In addition, some of these 3rd party text editors are in fact a part of something larger called an **Integrated Development Environment**, or **IDE** for short.  An IDE is a software package that includes a text editor (like those we've been discussing) as well as a file manager, a compiler and a debugger.  In this way, a user has access to a much wider range of features and can move far beyond the initial code while remaining confidant that the various tools will work with each other reliably becuase they are all a part of the same integrated environment.
