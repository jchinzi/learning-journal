**Operators and Loops**

<p style="text-align: center;">A quick overview of Comparision Operators.  Comparison Operators evaluate a situration and return a Boolean: true or false.</p>

|Symbol|Name|Description|
|:-:|:--|--:|
|==|Is Equal To|Compares two values to see if they are the same.|
|!=|Is Not Equal To|Compares two values to see if they are *not* the same.|
|===|Strict Equal To|Compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same.|
|!==|Strict Not Equal To|Compares two values to check that both the data type and value are *not* the same.|
|>|Greater Than|Checks if the number on the left is *greater than* the number on the right.|
|<|Less Than|Checks if the number on the left is *less than* the number on the right.|
|>=|Greater Than or Equal To|Checks if the number on the left is *greater than or equal to* the number on the right.|
|<=|Less Than or Equal To|Checks if the number on the left is *less than or eqal to* the number on the right.

<p style="text-align: center;">Logical Operators allow you to compare the results of more than one Comparison Operator.</p>

|Symbol|Name|Description|
|:-:|:--|--:|
|&&|Logical And|Tests more than one condition.  If *all* expressions evaluate to true, then the expression returns true.|
|`||`|Logical Or|Tests at least one condition.  If *any* expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns true.|
|!|Logical Not|Takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.|

<p style="text-align: center;">Loops check a condition.  If it returns true, a code block will run.  Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.  This will continue until the condition returns false.</p>

|Loop Type|Description|
|:--|--:|
|For|Runs code **for** a specific number of times, often by using a counter.|
|While|Code will run for as long as the specified condition is true - useful when you don't know how many times the code will need to run.|
|Do While|Similar to *while* loops, **except that** it will always run the statement inside the curly braces at least once, *even if the condition evaluates to false*.
