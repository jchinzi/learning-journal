**Programming with JavaScript**

#### Introduction

*How does JavaScript make web pages more interactive?*

JavaScript allows one to:
* *access* content
* *modify* content
* *program* rules
* *react* to events

#### What is a Script?  And how do I create one?

A *script* is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.  Ergo, to write a *script* you need to state your goal and then list the tasks needed to achieve that goal.

In other words, to write a *script* one needs to:

1. Define the Goal
1. Design the Script (ie divide the overall task into a series of smaller tasks - a flowchart can be helpful with this)
1. Code Each Step...using JavaScript!

#### Expressions

> **Expression**: any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expresssions that evaluates to a single value

* Some expressions simply assign a value to a variable
* Some expressions use two or more values to return a single value

> **Operators**: allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

* *Assignment Operators* assign a value to a variable
* *Arithmetic Operators* perform basic math using a variety of symbols (details below)
* *String Operators* combine two strings using the + symbol.  This is also known as *concatenation*
* *Comparison Operators* compare two values and return true or false
* *Logical Operators*  combine expressions and return true or false

|Name|Operator|Purpose|
|:--|:-:|--:|
|Addition| + |Adds one value to another|
|Subtraction| - |Subtracts one value from another|
|Division| / |Divides two values|
|Multiplication| * |Multiplies two values using an astrisk (**not** the letter x)|
|Increment| ++ |Adds one to the current number|
|Decrement| -- |Subtracts one from the current number|
|Modulus| % |Divides two values and returns the remainder|

#### Functions

> **Functions** group and store a series of statements together to perform a specific task.  A function can be reused to repeat the same task.

* To *call* a function is to ask that function to perform it's task.
* A *code block* consists of one or more statements contained within curley braces that make up the steps of a function.
* *Parameters* are pieces of information that are passed to functions in order for them to complete their task.
* A *return value* is the name for the response a function provides.
    * The *return* keyword is used to return a value to the code that called the function.
* To declare a funcion, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside curly braces.  This is known as a function declaration.
*To *call* a function, you use the function name followed by parentheses.  If that function has parameters, they are included within those parentheses.
    * Within the function, named parameters act like variable names.
