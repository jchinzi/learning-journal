### Monday, April 27th   

**Learning Markdown**

Markdown is a quick and easy way to format content for the web!  This allows for everyone from experts to novices to publish content online that looks polished and professional in a small amount of time.  Below I've assembled a reference chart that covers some of the more widely used tools for text editing in Markdown.  

Description | Markdown Syntax | End Result
----------- |---------------- | ------------
Italic | `*Looking super fancy in italics*` | *Looking super fancy in italics*
Bold | `**Making a statement using bold**` | **Making a statement using bold**
Bold & Italic | `***This is clearly the most important thing!***` | ***This is clearly the most important thing!***
Strikethrough | `~~Changed my mind, strike that~~` | ~~Changed my mind, strike that~~

You can also use Markdown to set your headings by adding a `#` before your text.  Take a look up top, that date is actually an `<h3>` and in the code line looks like this: `### Monday, April 27th`.  If we wanted to go bigger, we could lose a couple of those hashmarks and change it to an `<h1>` header instead.

In some ways, Markdown is actually very intuitive.  Take lists, for example.  Simly by adding an `*` followed by a space, you can make a bullet point.  Ergo, your shopping list can look like this:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Flour

Don't forget that space between the `*` and the list item, though, or you'll wind up with nothing but a lot of bold words! 

If order matters, such as in a recipe, then just change the `*` to a `1.` and you're ready to make an ordered list.  Check it out:

#### Dutch Baby Recipe
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
1. Combine 2 eggs, 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup milk.  Whisk until smooth.
1. Pour batter into a greased cast iron pan.
1. Bake for 20 minutes.
1. Enjoy!

There's certainly more to do with Markup, but this should be a good start.  And remember - when in doubt, google it and experiment!  Because as the great David Blaine once said, 
>Whether you're shuffling a deck of cards or holding your breath, magic is pretty simple: It comes down to training, practice, and experimentation, followed up by ridiculous pursuit and relentless perseverance.
