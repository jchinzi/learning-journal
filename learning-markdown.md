**Learning Markdown**

Markdown is a quick and easy way to format content for the web!  This allows for everyone from experts to novices to publish content online that looks polished and professional in a small amount of time.  Below I've assembled a reference chart that covers some of the more widely used tools for text editing in Markdown.  

Description | Markdown Syntax | End Result
----------- |---------------- | ------------
Italic | `*Looking super fancy in italics*` | *Looking super fancy in italics*
Bold | `**Making a statement using bold**` | **Making a statement using bold**
Bold & Italic | `***This is clearly the most important thing!***` | ***This is clearly the most important thing!***
Strikethrough | `~Changed my mind, strike that~` | ~Changed my mind, strike that~

You can also use Markdown to set your headings by adding a `#` before your text.  Take a look up top, that date is actually an `<h3>` and in the code line looks like this: `### Monday, April 27th`.  If we wanted to go bigger, we could lose a couple of those hashmarks and change it to an `<h1>` header instead, like so:
  # Monday, April 27th   
but that seems excessive, doesn't it?

In some ways, Markdown is actually very intuitive.  Take lists, for example.  Simly by adding an `*` followed by a space, you can make a bullet point.  Ergo, your shopping list can look like this:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Bread

Don't forget that space between the `*` and the list item, though, or you'll wind up with nothing but a lot of bold words :wink: 

Oh yeah, and Markdown supports emojis too!  You can check [this cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#smileys--emotion) to see options available, but must come down to a descriptor of the emoji in between two colons.  That one I used earlier is just called wink.

There's certainly more to do with Markup, but this should be a good start.  And remember - when in doubt, google it and experiment!  Because as the great David Blaine once said, 
>Whether you're shuffling a deck of cards or holding your breath, magic is pretty simple: It comes down to training, practice, and experimentation, followed up by ridiculous pursuit and relentless perseverance.
